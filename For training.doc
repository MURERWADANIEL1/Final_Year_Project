In each of these files in these folders is .npy files which was extracted from the audio data 

Each file name is divided into 9 elements, separated with underscores (_).

1. Patient number (101,102,...,226)
2.  Recording index
3.  Chest location
 a. Trachea (Tc)
        b. Anterior left (Al)
 c. Anterior right (Ar)
 d. Posterior left (Pl)
 e. Posterior right (Pr)
 f. Lateral left (Ll)
 g. Lateral right (Lr) 
4. Acquisition mode 
 a. sequential/single channel (sc), 
 b. simultaneous/multichannel (mc)
5.  Recording equipment 
     a. AKG C417L Microphone (AKGC417L), 
     b. 3M Littmann Classic II SE Stethoscope (LittC2SE), 
     c. 3M Litmmann 3200 Electronic Stethoscope (Litt3200), 
     d.  WelchAllyn Meditron Master Elite Electronic Stethoscope (Meditron)

The annotation text files have four columns:
- Beginning of respiratory cycle(s)
- End of respiratory cycle(s)
- Presence/absence of crackles (presence=1, absence=0)
- Presence/absence of wheezes (presence=1, absence=0)

The abbreviations used in the diagnosis file are:
- COPD: Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease
- LRTI: Lower Respiratory Tract Infection
- URTI: Upper Respiratory Tract Infection

6. Segment number derived from annotation information. a single file can have several segments named systematically seg1, seg2 etc

7. Crackle number with C0.0 being no crackle and C1.0 there is a crackle

8. Wheezle number with W0.0 being no Wheezle and W1.0 there is a Wheezle

A given segment can have C0.0 and W0.0 or W0.0 and C1.0 or C0.0 and W1.0 or W1.0 and C1.0

9. Augmentation number. Where some files were augmented to sort the data imbalance
Every augmented file has all first 8 elements and added aug1, aug2 etc. to them to show it has been augmented. 


In summary: 111_1b2_Tc_sc_Meditron_seg0_C0.0_W0.0_aug1.npy is an example
111, Patient number
1b2, Recording index
Tc, Chest location
sc, Acquisition mode  
Meditron, Recording equipment
seg0, Segment number
C0.0, crackle
W0.0, Wheezle
aug1, Augmentation number
.npy, file extension
